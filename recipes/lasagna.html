                <li>1 yellow onion diced</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
                <li>36 ounces pasta sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>2 cups ricotta cheese or cottage cheese</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>1 large egg beaten</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente according to package directions.  Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet brown the beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains.  Drain any fat.</li>
                <li>Stir in pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.  Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Taste and season with additional salt if desired.</li>
                <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine 11/2 cups mozzarella, 1/4 cup parmesan, ricotta, parsley, egg, and 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9x13 pan or casserole dish.  Top it with 3 lasagna noodles.  Layer with 1 cup of the ricotta cheese and 1 cup of meat sauce.  Repeat twice more.  Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
                <li>Cover with foil and bake 45 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove foil and sprinkle the top with remaining mozzarella and parmesan cheese.  Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly.  Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
                <li>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting</li>
            </ol>
