        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>This site is the result of a project that I worked through in the Odin Project.  The project consisted of trying to semantically write up a multi-page HTML site and apply CSS based on what was learned.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>While this site does contain usable recipes its purpose is familiarization with HTML and CSS formating and flow.  We hope the end result is one that shines favorably on a pupil of web development.<p>
